A low medieval manor house, a post station, partly fortified, probably on Roman or Etruscan foundations, composed of several different volumes and belonging to diverse eras.
In order to better and easily distribute the different volumes, a central compass was created together with new communication stairs.
Another theme was the reconstruction of the tower remodeled over time.
The reconstruction of the tower was carried out with "Volterra travertine" and tuff ashlars recovered from ruins found nearby.  The property is enriched by a panoramic view on the roof and the profile of the hills of Volterra with the series of tufa-colored dwellings on the horizon.

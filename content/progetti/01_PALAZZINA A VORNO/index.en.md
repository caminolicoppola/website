The Mansion, medium to large in size, and built with Guamo stones, is arranged in length on the hillsides behind the hamlet of Vorno, in the municipality of Capannori (Lucca).
Dating back to the early medieval period, it is located in the center of a small valley on an ancient local road that passed behind it. The goal of the project was to block the access of undifferentiated cars to the existing area in front of the house. The opportunity to make a small extension suggested that we could stop the access road with a thin and elongated element so as to close off the entire space.
Inside the new building there is a greenhouse for citrus trees, while the roof is enriched by a roof top terrace with pergola.

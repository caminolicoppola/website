This farm consists of two houses, the main one and a smaller one not far away; both are equipped with a large panoramic pool.
The main house is located on top of a hill with a complete panoramic view and has undergone a radical renovation.
It was decided to create the distributive heart of the house with the staircase so as to free all the overlooks in favor of the rooms and bathrooms.
In addition, the staircase became so important that it could not be an element of mere distribution and thus became a crossroads for all the inhabitants of the house, a library, a small teaching room.

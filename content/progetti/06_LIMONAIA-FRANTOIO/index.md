This building was the oil mill of Miralunga Villa and has now been designated as a dwelling. It was a radical renovation with consolidation works on the structure. Some artifacts from the oil mill have been preserved, such as the millstone and the press, which has been turned into the hall fireplace. This building is the final part of the villaâ€™s garden design because it closes the garden in the east end.

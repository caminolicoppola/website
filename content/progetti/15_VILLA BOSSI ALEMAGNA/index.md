Villa Bossi Alemagna is one of the historic villas in Azzate. It is a 17th century villa, probably of monastic layout. Some remarkable frescoes are found in the rooms on the ground floor and first floor.
The villa has been radically restored with the consolidation of all the floors, the insertion of underfloor heating, and the radical renovation of the lateral parts.
The main theme was the recovery of the courtyard open to the garden with the alignment of the first-floor windows, the opening of the windows in the west part - closed over time - in order to reestablish the original space.
The reconstruction of the courtyard has been done with river pebbles as in the Lombard tradition.
The cantilevered eaves with their corbels and struts have been completely restored.

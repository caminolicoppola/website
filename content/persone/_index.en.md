Paola: 'Paola Coppola - graduated from the University of Florence in 1984 with a thesis on the city of Lucca - she opened her studio in Lucca in 1990 dealing mainly with renovation works.'
Collab: 'In 1998 she began the collaboration concerning the renovation and consolidation of some historical buildings such as villas, farms, farmhouses, mansions, etc.
In some of these interventions, renovations with extension possibilities were also taken into consideration, especially in those cases where -of course- the theme was about the assonance between the old and the new.
In the last few years, we have also been working on new constructions, mainly in Tuscany and Apulia.'
